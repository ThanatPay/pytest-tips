A primer of pytest

#### Start virtual environment
Create virtual environment into an invisible directory inside your home directory that it's not going to be accidentally pushed into your GitHub repo.
```
virtualenv ~/.venv
```
activate virtual environment
```
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
```
But when you change bash terminal it out of virtual environment. You can fix this by set default in bashrc
`vim ~/.bashrc`
